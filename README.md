# MSTU5003Final
For my project I decided to expand on a my pre-existing interactive Dr. Seuss webpage. Many children grow up reading Dr. Seuss books, but the goal of this website is to give students a new way to interact with the world of Dr. Seuss. In part one students can create their own mini-story and give it an illustration. They can also engage in self-evaluation and get instant teacher feedback based on the rating they select. In part two students get to have some more fun by taking a quiz to see which Dr. Seuss character they are most like. The interactive elements in this site were designed to give students a chance to meaningfully engage with the learning material.
